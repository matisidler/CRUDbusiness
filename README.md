# CRUDbusiness
CRUD in Golang using MySQL &amp; PostgreSQL with tables related to business.

In this CRUD i'm implementing the DAO factor. That's mean you can manage 2 drivers (in this case, PostgreSQL and MySQL) in the same program with the same commands.
This is easy, just create an interface to make differents querys to different databases.
